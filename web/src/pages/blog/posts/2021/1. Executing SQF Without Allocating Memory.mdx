So recently I purchased a [Screamer PCIe] from LambdaConcept. 
Personally, I would not recommend buying one of these as two of the three cards
I purchased were dead on arrival. However, thanks to the one device that did work,
I have been given an opportunity to once again approach attacking the Arma 3
engine from a C++ perspective.

The first thing I wanted to do with it was arbitary SQF execution in Arma.
This is a bit of a challenge, as I can't allocate any memory via DMA.
So I had to come up with a unique way to execute an arbitrarily large script
without allocating memory for the script code to go into.

In order to execute SQF via memory, there are only a few approaches that are decent.
[GameState::Execute] and [OnEachFrame] are my two favorite methods. 

The first method requires we call the Execute virtual function in the GameState object.
Doing this over DMA is tricky, as we can't create our own threads or allocate our own code.
`OnEachFrame` is a lot simpler. 
By writing a `GameDataString` (Or `GameDataCode`!) pointer to a global variable,
the engine will execute our code every frame.

So we'll be using `OnEachFrame` for our exploit. 
However, this still begs the question, 
how can we construct an object for our code to go into?

---

Well, there are actually a few ways to achieve this. 
Here is one example, have the cheater open 3DEN and define their script like this:

`MY_BAD_CODE = { hint 'bad code'; };`

Now we can use our DMA device to find the `GameDataCode` pointer for that variable.
By bumping its reference count by 1, we ensure it's not released when we leave 3DEN.
Now we can join a server and simply push that pointer onto the onEachFrame value and walla!

This works, but it requires user input. 
I created a technique for executing arbitrary code without requiring any user input
and a very limited scope for SQF based anti-cheats to detect.

---

First, we need a buffer to write our script into. 
Thankfully any existing `GameDataCode` variable contains an `ArmaString` pointer
to its value. So when I run `str(var)` this `ArmaString` is what we see in the output.

As of Arma 2.04 that can be found here:
![offset chain](https://ss.lystic.zip/2021-07-22/02-48-09/rHuHGUPAVqPU7LNfpnFfQp7F.png)

Using a variable in the `uiNamespace` such as `BIS_fnc_diagWiki`, 
we have a large buffer we can write with our script into. 
This string, however, is not used for `GameDataCode` execution. 

We can't simply modify this and stick the `GameDataCode` pointer into `onEachFrame`.
So we need to find a `GameDataString` variable that can be used. 
I will leave finding a string variable in the `uiNamespace` as an exercise for the reader.

---

Let's jump right into the C++ code for this and explain what is being done step by step.

Step one is to find our target `GameDataCode` and `GameDataString` pointers in the `uiNamespace`.

```cpp
uint64_t uiNamespaceADDR = arma->GetBase() + Arma::Offsets::UINamespace;
std::cout << "Finding variables in uiNamespace...";
std::vector<std::string> variables = {
    code_variable,
    string_variable
};
std::map<std::string, uint64_t> results = FindScriptVariables(arma, uiNamespaceADDR, variables);
uint64_t GameDataCode_FUNC = results[code_variable];
uint64_t GameDataString_VAR = results[string_variable];
std::cout << "Func 0x" << std::hex << GameDataCode_FUNC;
std::cout << " | Var 0x" << std::hex << GameDataString_VAR << std::endl;
if (!GameDataCode_FUNC)
{
    ERR("Failed to find code variable");
    return;
}
if (!GameDataString_VAR)
{
    ERR("Failed to find string variable");
    return;
}
```

Second, we need to identify the internal `ArmaString` value pointers for these objects.
One of these two values will be where our attacking sqf code is written to.

```cpp
std::cout << "Extracting armastring pointers...";
uint64_t func_armastring = arma->Read<uint64_t>(GameDataCode_FUNC + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, false);
uint64_t var_armastring = arma->Read<uint64_t>(GameDataString_VAR + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, false);
std::cout << "Func 0x" << std::hex << func_armastring;
std::cout << " | Var 0x" << std::hex << var_armastring << std::endl;
if (!func_armastring)
{
    ERR("Failed to extract code armastring");
    return;
}
if (!var_armastring)
{
    ERR("Failed to extract string armastring");
    return;
}
```

Next, we need to be on the safe side and ensure our `ArmaString` buffer is large
enough for our script (otherwise we need to pick a new SQF variable).

```cpp
std::cout << "Checking if buffer is large enough..." << std::endl;
uint32_t buffer_size = max(func_size, var_size);
int extra_spaces = (buffer_size - injected_script.size()) - 1; //TODO: not sure if this -1 needs to be here or not!!!
int minimum_extra_chars = std::string("comment\"\";").size();
extra_spaces -= minimum_extra_chars;
if (extra_spaces < 0)
{
    ERR("Variable Buffer Not Large Enough");
    return;
}
```

Now comes a very important step. When we write our attacking script we need to
add "filler" sqf that will ensure our code **matches** the size of our original string.
If we do not do this, Arma will automatically resize this string and bad things will happen in future steps.
You may notice the `minimum_extra_chars` variable from above, this comes into use here.

```cpp
std::cout << "Generating payload..." << std::endl;
injected_script += "comment\"";
for (int i = 0; i < extra_spaces; i++)
    injected_script += (char)0x32; 
injected_script += "\";";
```

Above we assumed that our `GameDataCode` buffer would be larger, 
but that may not always be the case. If our `GameDataString` is larger, we can just write to that.
However, if our `GameDataCode` is larger we need to swap the internal `ArmaString` pointers. 
This is like doing `stringvariable = str(codevariable);`.

```cpp
bool did_swap = false;
if (func_size > var_size)
{
    did_swap = true;
    std::cout << "Swapping internal string pointers..." << std::endl;

    //swap our variables
    if (!arma->Write(GameDataCode_FUNC + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, var_armastring) ||
        !arma->Write(GameDataString_VAR + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, func_armastring))
    {
        ERR("Failed to swap variable armastring values");
        return;
    }

    //update pointers so we don't get confused as to what values are where
    uint32_t temp = func_size;
    func_size = var_size;
    var_size = temp;

    uint64_t temp2 = func_armastring;
    func_armastring = var_armastring;
    var_armastring = temp2;
}
```

Finally, we get to write our attacking SQF to the `GameDataString`'s (possibly new!) `ArmaString` pointer.
We need to read out the original code for future steps here.

```cpp
char* original_code = new char[var_size];
if (!arma->Read(var_armastring + Arma::Offsets::o_ArmaStringValue, original_code, var_size, false))
{
    ERR("Failed to read the original function code");
    return;
}

std::cout << "Writing payload to variable..." << std::endl;
char* payloadBuffer = new char[var_size];
ZeroMemory(payloadBuffer, var_size);
if (strcpy_s(payloadBuffer, var_size, injected_script.c_str()))
{
    ERR("Failed to copy injected script into payload buffer");
    return;
}
if (injected_script.size() != (var_size - 1))
{
    ERR("Injected script wrong size. Cannot write payload.");
    std::cout << injected_script.size() << " | " << var_size << std::endl;
    return;
}
if (!arma->Write(var_armastring + Arma::Offsets::o_ArmaStringValue, payloadBuffer, var_size))
{
    ERR("Failed to write payload");
    delete[] payloadBuffer;
    return;
}
delete[] payloadBuffer;
```

---

Okay! Time for a break. At this point we have a string in SQF that contains our
attacking code without allocating any memory.
We've achieved part of our goal. 
Next we will execute this code using the `OnEachFrame` method Douggem outlined.

Firstly, we will need the original `onEachFrame` value. 
We'll reset this pointer when we're done to ensure we restore the game's state.

```cpp
std::cout << "Reading original onEachFrame value...";
uint64_t old_value = arma->Read<uint64_t>(arma->GetBase() + Arma::Offsets::EachFrame, false);
std::cout << " 0x" << std::hex << old_value << std::endl;
```

Lets discuss a bit about Arma reference counts. 
Every `GameData` object has a count for the number of references to it. 
When the game is done with the object it'll call the `Release()` virtual function.
This will decrement the objects reference count, and if the count drops below 1,
it will free the memory. When we change the value of `OnEachFrame`, 
the previous value is Released as well. 

So in order to keep our game from crashing if `OnEachFrame` is changed in the future,
our custom value needs to have it's reference count incremented by 1.

So our next job is to bump the refernce count of our `GameDataString` variable.
This reference count is stored 8 bytes in.

```cpp
std::cout << "Incrementing variable refrence count..." << std::endl;
uint32_t refcount = (arma->Read<uint32_t>(GameDataString_VAR + 0x8, false)) + 1;
if (!arma->Write(GameDataString_VAR + 0x8, refcount))
{
    ERR("Failed to bump reference count");
    return;
}
```

Okay, now our `GameDataString` variable is ready to go into `OnEachFrame`!

```cpp
std::cout << "Injecting payload..." << std::endl;
if (!arma->Write(arma->GetBase() + Arma::Offsets::EachFrame, GameDataString_VAR))
{
    ERR("Failed to write new eachframe value");
    return;
}
```

If you were paying close enough attention you'll have noticed I added something
else into the injected payload. After our custom SQF executes, the code 
`onEachFrame {};` is run. This will wipe out our custom `onEachFrame` code, 
but most importantly it makes it so we can detect once our custom SQF has 
completed execution (or if it has an error!). 
By reading the `OnEachFrame` value's internal `ArmaString` pointer, we can see if `onEachFrame` was cleared.

```cpp
std::cout << "Waiting for payload execution..." << std::endl;
bool success = true;
ULONGLONG timeout = GetTickCount64() + 5000;
do
{
    // when we run onEachFrame{}; it will create a gameDataCode with a null value pointer as the eachFrame object. We just need to check if it's null then we know our code ran.
    uint64_t eachFrameGameDataCode = arma->Read<uint64_t>(arma->GetBase() + Arma::Offsets::EachFrame, false);
    if (eachFrameGameDataCode)
    {
        uint64_t armastringValue = arma->Read<uint64_t>(eachFrameGameDataCode + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, false);
        if (!armastringValue)
            break;
    }
    Sleep(10);

    if (GetTickCount64() >= timeout)
    {
        success = false;
        break;
    }

} while (true);
if (!success)
{
    ERR("Failed to detect payload execution. Was there an SQF error?");
}
```

---

Awesome! At this point we know our sqf was injected and executed. 
From here, we can go about restoring the game state such that no one 
will have ever known we executed something. I am kinda tired of creating
all these snippets, so here is that restoration code:

```cpp
if (old_value != 0)
{
    std::cout << "Restoring original onEachFrame..." << std::endl;
    if (!arma->Write(arma->GetBase() + Arma::Offsets::EachFrame, old_value))
    {
        ERR("Failed to write new eachframe value");
        return;
    }
}

if (did_swap)
{
    std::cout << "Restoring internal string pointers..." << std::endl;

    //swap our variables
    if (!arma->Write(GameDataCode_FUNC + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, var_armastring) ||
        !arma->Write(GameDataString_VAR + Arma::Offsets::o_GameDataCodeValue, func_armastring))
    {
        ERR("Failed to swap variable armastring values");
        return;
    }

    //update pointers so we don't get confused as to what values are where
    uint32_t temp = func_size;
    func_size = var_size;
    var_size = temp;

    uint64_t temp2 = func_armastring;
    func_armastring = var_armastring;
    var_armastring = temp2;
}

std::cout << "Restoring original function code..." << std::endl;
if (!arma->Write(func_armastring + Arma::Offsets::o_ArmaStringValue, original_code, func_size))
{
    ERR("Failed to restore original function code");
    return;
}
```

So now we've executed our custom sqf without allocating any memory! 
Very cool. Finally I want to give my closing thoughts on detection vectors for this approach.

By restoring our game state, we made it so there are no artifacts from executing our SQF.
This makes it extremely difficult for sqf based anticheats to detect. 
I think that detecting something like this really just isn't feasible,
but it'd be possible to try and synchronize some variables between `onEachFrame`
and MissionEventHandler "EachFrame" to see if they fall out of sync 
(and thus detect that onEachFrame missed a frame or two of execution).

In reality, I think the best way to detect something like this is by detecting 
the SQF cheat being executed. You can't rely on BattlEye Filters because 
the cheater who is using this execution method probably disabled those anyway.

Anyway, I thought this was a neat trick as most people just allocate space for
these things or use `gamestate::execute`. I am excited to showcase some more 
things in the future like ways to bypass SQF no-recoil detection.
