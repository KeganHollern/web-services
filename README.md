# Lystic's Web Platform

Hi! I got bored at work and decided I wanted to expand my personal web services and make them open source.

Feel free to open a PR and make changes, but if you do anything complex I won't understand it and won't merge it!

Also, no updating dependencies! I do not want a supply-chain hack to happen to any users.
