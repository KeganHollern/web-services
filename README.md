# Lystic's Web Platform

Hi! I got bored at work and decided I wanted to expand my personal web services and make them open source.

The goal is to create zero-trust systems where any data which hits my servers is completely encrypted on the client side.

Feel free to open a PR and make changes, but if you do anything complex I won't understand it and won't merge it!

## Page Completion

Of the well-defined services, here are their "completion" progress:

- [x] home: homepage
- [ ] blog: personal blog
- [x] secret: zero-trust secret sharing service
- [ ] edit: collaborative markdown editor
- [ ] swap: fee-less uniswap frontend alternative
- [ ] upload: password protected file uploader (maybe encrypted one day?)

## Dependencies

None yet. Soon maybe Mongo? I want to horizontally scale
my website.

## Future Services

- p2p screen sharing (using chrome api & p2p webrtc to avoid sending data to my server)
- file converter (ideally in-browser using webassembly...)

feel free to add a PR suggesting new services!
